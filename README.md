#Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

The data was obtained from experiments conducted on 30 volunteers.  Each volunteer performed 6 activities (Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing and Laying) while wearing a Samsung Galaxy smartphone on their waist.  The subjects were divided into a Test group and a Train group.  

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

##Aim

	1.	Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2.	Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	3.	Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4.	Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
	5.	From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Results

The results are stored in the Github Results Repo shown below and include this Read_Me file, a Code_Book, the run_Analysis.R code and the two output files:
